This program is built on Júlio Vilmar Gesser's excellent Java parser which is 
released under LGPLv3. Included in this distribution is Log4j which is released
under the Apache License 2.0. Copies of the licenses are included under the
"licenses"-folder.  

This is a binary build of the 2010-07-27 version. The full source can be downloaded from http://ftog.googlecode.com


To run this example project:
----------------------------
Make sure you have ant installed and in your path. Help with ant can be found 
at: http://ant.apache.org. Place yourself under the "generator_script"-folder.
Run ant. Now the java DTO classes under dto_src will be translated to actionscript
and stored under "generated_classes".

Every time the generator is run the actionscript classes is regenerated. It is 
therefore a bad idea to add business methods to the generated classes. A good
design is to let your DTOs be just that, i.e. containers of data with no business
logic in them neither on java-side nor on actionscript-side. Note also that the
generator does not write actionscript classes which does not seem to be DTOs. The
criteria to qualify as a DTO is that the resulting actionscript class have at least
one property or that it is a subclass to something else than Object.

Known issues:
-------------
Mixing arrays and generics does not work well. For example the following property 
would be translated wrong: "public ArrayList<Rollercoaster[]> rollerMatrix;"
