To run this example project:
----------------------------
Make sure you have ant installed and in your path. Help with ant can be found 
at: http://ant.apache.org. Place yourself under the "generator_script"-folder.
Run ant. Now the java DTO classes under dto_src will be translated to actionscript
and stored under "generatedClasses".

Every time the generator is run the actionscript classes is regenerated. It is therefore a bad idea to add business methods to the generated classes. A good
design is to let your DTOs be just that, i.e. containers of data with no business
logic in them neither on java-side nor on actionscript-side. Note also that the
generator does not write actionscript classes which does not seem to be DTOs. The
criteria to qualify as a DTO is that the resulting actionscript class have at least
one property or that is a subclass.

Known issues:
-------------
Mixing arrays and generics does not work well. For example the following property 
would be translated wrong: "public ArrayList<Rollercoaster[]> rollerMatrix;"
